List installed packages using apt: If you want a more detailed list (including versions), you can run:


apt list --installed > apt-installed-packages.txt

This command will generate a file with a list of installed packages, including version numbers.

List only manually installed packages: If you want to exclude dependencies and only list packages that you installed manually, use this:


comm -23 <(apt-mark showmanual | sort) <(apt-mark showauto | sort) > manual-packages.txt

This will give you a list of manually installed packages, which you can use to create a clean setup guide.

Once you have the list, you can share it with others, and they can install the same packages using:


sudo apt install $(cat manual-packages.txt)

You can also use a tool like apt-clone to make a backup of your installed packages and settings for easy restoration on another system:

sudo apt install apt-clone
apt-clone clone mysetup

This will create a backup of your setup, which can be restored on a different machine.
